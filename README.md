# Chord Changer

__THIS DOES NOT WORK 100% OF THE TIME, ESPECIALLY WITH INVERSIONS. PLEASE CHECK THE CHART__

This program changes chord sheets from letter to greek numbers. It has a gui that allows you to convert multiple chord charts very quickly.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Python 3.* installed before running this program.

### Installing
simply clone this repository and then run the magic.py file:
```
python magic.py
```

### Using
In the gui, you are prompted for the key that the song is in. Enter it and then copy paste the untranslated chart to the left side. Click the translate button and then copy the translated chart from the right side to wherever you need it.

### What I learned
This was just a project to get me more comfortable with python and to learn the basics of tkinter (which I now prefer over using Java and swing :P)

### What I could Improve
I could make it so that users can flag the lines that contain the chord marking alongside the systems automatic chord marking detectection. I could also allow the text boxes to grow and shrink as the user changes the size of the window.
