Goodness of God - Bethel

           I
I love You Lord
        IV             I
Oh Your mercy never fails me
 E/G#  F#m
All my days
          IV              V
I’ve been held in Your hands
                       vi
From the moment that I wake up
IV             I  V/viidim  vi
Until I lay my head
       IV             V        I
I will sing of the goodness of God


IV                         I
All my life You have been faithful
IV                         I      V
All my life You have been so, so good
IV                           I  V/viidim  vi
With every breath that I am able
       IV             V        I
I will sing of the goodness of God


I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest nights
You are close like no other
I’ve known You as a father
I’ve known You as a friend
I have lived in the goodness of God


I/C#             IV                   V               I
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
I/C#             IV                   V               I
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
          I/C#                   IV
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now,
  V             vi
I give You everything
I/C#             IV                   V               I
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
