[Verse 1]
Cadd9
God of creation
vi                    V                    IVadd9  vi    V
There at the start, before the beginning of time
     IVadd9
With no point of reference
    vi                    V                        IVadd9  I/iii   V
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light

[Chorus]
             I
And as You speak
                  vi               V
A hundred billion galaxies are born
                      I/iii              IVadd9
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
         vi                 IVadd9           I
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
                        vi                     V
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
                        I/iii        IVadd9
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
      vi                 IVadd9           I   vi   V   I/iii
If creation sings Your praises, so will I

[Verse 2]
Cadd9
God of Your promise
    vi                      V                IVadd9 vi     V
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
    IVadd9
For once You have spoken
    vi                  V                       IVadd9  I/iii   V
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice

[Chorus 2]
             I
And as You speak
                    vi                        V
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
               I/iii            IVadd9
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
       vi               IVadd9           I
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
                        vi                V
I can see Your heart in everything You say
                     I/iii          IVadd9
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
      vi           IVadd9              I   vi 
If creation still obeys You, so will I
         V I/iii        IVadd9  vi    V   IVadd9  vi    V
(So will I,    so will I)

[Bridge]
         IVadd9                              vi    V
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
          IVadd9                             vi    V
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
        IVadd9                               vi    V
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
        IVadd9                         vi            V
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
           IVadd9                                 vi    V
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
       IVadd9                              vi    V
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
       IVadd9                                 vi    V
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
           IVadd9                         vi     V   IV      vi    V
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times


IVadd9  vi    V

[Verse 3]
Cadd9
God of salvation
    vi                           V                    IVadd9   vi    V
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
     IVadd9
On a hill You created
    vi                  V                      IVadd9  I/iii   V
The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

[Chorus 3]
             I
And as You speak
                  vi                V
A hundred billion failures disappear
                            I/iii           IVadd9
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
        vi              IVadd9              I
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
                        vi                    V
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
                         I/iii              IVadd9
Every part designed in a work of art called love
       vi               IVadd9           I
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
                               vi                    V
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
                      I/iii             IVadd9
Every precious one, a child You died to save
       vi                IVadd9               I
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

[Outro]
                       vi             V
Like You would again a hundred billion times
                       I/iii             IVadd9
But what measure could amount to Your desire
           vi            IVadd9             I
You're the One who never leaves the one behind
